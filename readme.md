Funko Collector is a an app where you can track Funko Pop's that you own or that you would like to obtain in the future.  
  There is an global library where you can browse individual funkos and their details.  
  If you are logged in to the site, you can see your own personal collection or personal wishlist pages.
  I've included pagination and a search mechanism in the global library.
  
  The app is built in Python/Django with a multi-model(1:1, 1:M, M:M) PostGres database.  There's also some HTML/CSS/JS in there as well for some of the front end.
  
  The next features I will be updating will be:
    *adding remove feature for collection/wishlist
    *expanding search and filtering
    *incorporate some API's to show market value and buying links
    *expand on profile functionalities (level-up badging statuses)
